## Simplifying Square Roots
### Square root 
<pre>
Definition:
  a number which produces a specified quantity when multiplied by <strong>itself</strong>.
  example: 9 = 3 * 3
            So, here 3 multiplied by itself is 9.
            Therefore, square root of 9 i.e. &radic;9 = 3.
</pre>

## Methods to simplify a square root
Simplifying a square root is a very easy.
To simplify a square root, factorise the number and pullout perfect squares of radical sign.
<br/>
To be efficient, you need to follow following steps:
###### step 1:
Simplifying a square root by factoring:
<br/>

  1)Divide by the smallest prime number possible.
  some smaller prime number are 2, 3, 5 ,7, 11, 13, 17...
  <br/>
  for example
  <pre>
  &radic;98 = &radic;2&times;49
            = &radic;2&times;7&times;7
  </pre>
  2)Finish simplifying by pulling out an integer
   In above example, pull out 7,
   <pre>&radic;98 = 7&times;&radic;2</pre>
   
###### Knowing the squares of integers upto 20 is very helpful
### Terminology:
  for example: &radic;49
  <br/>
  here,
  + "&radic;" is called <strong>radical symbol</strong>.
  + 49 is called <strong>radicand</strong>.
