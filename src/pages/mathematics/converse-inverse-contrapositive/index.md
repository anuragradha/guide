## Converse, Inverse, Contrapositive

Before you begin with converse, inverse, contrapositive, you should know about <strong>propositional variables and connectives</strong>.

###### Proposition:
A statement that has a truth value. i.e. it is either true or false.
e.g. 1) 2 + 3 = 7 is a proposition, with truth value <b>false</b>,<br>
 and 2) 2 + 3 = 5 is a proposition, with truth valur <b>true</b>.

###### Propositional Variable:
It is hectic to write the complete sentence each time.<br>
Therefore, we use capital letters to represent a proposition.<br>
e.g.
<b>P</b>: 2 + 3 = 5<br>
now, the complete statement is replaced by variable 'P'.

###### Connectives:
Connectives connect two simple propositions, to form a more elaborate proposition.
There are many propositions but following 2 are important in this discussion.

###### 1)Implication:
+ if..., then... (&rarr;)
<br/> This connective is most important in this discussion.

###### 2)Negation:
+ It is not the case that, ... (Symbol is &tilde; or &not; or &excl;)

  # Now, on to the main article
  
  # Converse
  <pre>
  Given two statements P and Q,
  and compound statement P &rarr; Q,<br>
  The converse is the statement represented by (Q &rarr; P)
  </pre>
  e.g.<br>
  P: Today is Sunday.<br>
  Q: Today is Holiday. <br>
  P -> Q: If today is Sunday, then today is holiday.<br>
  and converse is<br>
  Q &rarr; P: If today is holiday, then today is Sunday.

  # Inverse
  <pre>
  Given two statements P and Q,
  and compound statement P &rarr; Q,<br>
  The inverse is the statement represented by (&not;P &rarr; &not;Q)
  </pre>
  e.g.<br>
  P: Today is Sunday.<br>
  Q: Today is Holiday. <br>
  P -> Q: If today is Sunday, then today is holiday.<br>
  and inverse is<br>
  &not;P &rarr; &not;Q: If today is not Sunday, then today is not Holiday.

  # Contrapositive
   <pre>
  Given two statements P and Q,
  and compound statement P &rarr; Q,<br>
  The contrapositive is the statement represented by (&not;Q &rarr; &not;P)
  </pre>
   e.g.<br>
  P: Today is Sunday.<br>
  Q: Today is Holiday. <br>
  P -> Q: If today is Sunday, then today is holiday.<br>
  and contrapositive is<br>
  &not;Q &rarr; &not;P: If today is not Holiday, then today is not Sunday.
